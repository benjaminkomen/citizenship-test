# 2 - Rights and Responsibilities of Citizenship
The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms begins: “Whereas Canada is founded upon principles that recognize the
supremacy of God and the rule of law.”

These are the sources of Canadian law:

* laws passed by Parliament and the provincial legislatures
* English common law (e.g., habeas corpus – right to challenge unlawful detention)
* the civil code of France
* the unwritten constitution from Great Britain

Tradition of ordered liberty dates back to the Magna Carta (Great Charter of Freedoms) signed in England in 1215.

Fundamental Freedoms:

* Freedom of conscience and religion
* Freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of speech and of the press
* Freedom of peaceful assembly
* Freedom of association

The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (part of the Constitution, added in 1982):

* Mobility Rights: Right to live and work anywhere in Canada, to enter and leave Canada freely, and to apply for a
  passport
* Aboriginal Peoples’ Rights: Charter rights do not adversely affect any treaty or other rights or freedoms of
  Aboriginal peoples
* Official Language Rights and Minority Language Educational Rights: English and French have equal status in Parliament
  and government; minority language education rights in certain cases
* Multicultural Heritage: A fundamental characteristic of Canada; Canadians respect pluralism and live in harmony

Equality:

* In Canada, men and women are equal under the laws.
* Canada has no tolerance for barbaric cultural practices such as forced marriage, honour killings, female genital
  mutilation, spousal abuse, or other gender-based violence – these are crimes and severely punished.

Defending Canada:

* There is no compulsory military service.
* Serving in the Canadian Armed Forces (regular or reserves), Coast Guard, police, fire departments, or emergency
  services is a noble way to contribute to Canada and an excellent career choice.

Responsibilities of Canadian Citizens (all are important Canadian values; rights come with responsibilities):

1. Obey Canada’s laws – legally required
2. Take responsibility for oneself and one’s family (get a job, care for family) – important value, not legally required
3. Serve on a jury when called – legally required
4. Vote in elections (federal, provincial/territorial, municipal) – key responsibility, not legally required
5. Help others in the community (e.g., volunteering at food banks, schools, coaching, welcoming newcomers) – important
   value, not legally required
6. Protect and enjoy our heritage and environment (avoid waste and pollution, preserve natural and cultural heritage) –
   important value, not legally required

Common test questions from this chapter focus on:

* Supremacy of God and rule of law
* The four fundamental freedoms
* No compulsory military service
* Equality of men and women / no tolerance for barbaric practices
* The six responsibilities (especially which are legally required: only obeying laws and jury service)
* Voting as a responsibility

# 3 - Who We Are

## Introduction to Canada and Its Values

* Canada has the only constitutional monarchy in North America
* Canada is known for its values of peace, order, and good government
* The original Constitution (1867) was called the British North America Act
* Sir John A. Macdonald referred to Canada as the "Dominion of Canada"
* Canadian society stems largely from English-speaking and French-speaking Christian civilizations, with English and
  French as the official languages.

Three founding peoples of Canada are:

- Aboriginal Peoples (Indian/First Nations, Inuit, Métis)
- French
- British

## 3.1 - Aboriginal Peoples

- Ancestors migrated from Asia many thousands of years ago, established diverse cultures with religions beliefs about
  Creator and environment
- All regions occupied by native peoples; lived by hunting/gathering, farming, or fishing
- Aboriginal and treaty rights recognized in the Constitution; territorial rights first guaranteed by the Royal
  Proclamation of 1763 (King George III) – basis for treaties, though not always respected
- From the 1800s to the 1980s, many Aboriginal children placed in residential schools (poorly funded, hardship/abuse,
  languages/culture prohibited); federal government apologized in 2008.
- Today: Renewed pride, achievements in agriculture, environment, business, arts.

Three distinct peoples:

- First Nations (about 65% of Aboriginal peoples; formerly called "Indians"; term "First Nations" started in 1970s):
  About half live on reserve land (600 communities), half off-reserve (mostly urban).
- Inuit (about 4%; means "the people" in Inuktitut): Live in small communities across the Arctic; adapted to harsh
  environment with knowledge of land/sea/wildlife.
- Métis (about 30%; distinct people of mixed Aboriginal and European ancestry, mostly French/English-speaking, speak
  Michif dialect): Majority in Prairie provinces.

## 3.2 - English and French

* Federal government required by law to provide services throughout Canada in both English and French.
* About 18 million Anglophones (English first language).
* About 7 million Francophones (French first language): Majority in Quebec; significant in Ontario, New Brunswick,
  Manitoba.
* New Brunswick is the only officially bilingual province.

The Acadians:

- Descendants of French colonists who settled in Maritime provinces starting in 1604.
- During war between Britain and France (1755–1763), more than two-thirds deported in the "Great Upheaval" (or Great
  Deportation, ethnic cleansing).
- Acadians survived, maintain unique identity; culture flourishing today.

The Québécois (Quebecers):

- Mainly descendants of 8,500 French settlers from 1600s–1700s.
- Maintain unique identity, culture, language (mostly French-speaking).
- About 1 million Anglo-Québécois (English-speaking Quebecers with 250-year heritage).
- In 2006, House of Commons recognized the Québécois as a nation within a united Canada.

English Canadians:

- Way of life established by hundreds of thousands of English, Welsh, Scottish, and Irish settlers, soldiers, migrants (
  1600s–20th century).
- Generations of pioneers/builders of British origins (plus others) laid foundations of the country.

## 3.3 - Diversity in Canada

* Canada is a land of immigrants over 400 years; built by newcomers contributing to richness.
* Largest ethnic/religious groups (in order of size): English, French, Scottish, Irish, German, Italian, Chinese,
  Aboriginal, Ukrainian, Dutch, South Asian (Indian), Scandinavian.
* Since the 1970s, most immigrants from Asian countries.
* Non-official languages widely spoken; Chinese languages most common after English (especially in Vancouver and Toronto
  homes).
* Majority of Canadians identify as Christian (largest: Catholic, then Protestant denominations).
* Growing numbers: Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, Jews, no religion.
* State partners with faith communities for social welfare, harmony, schools, health care, refugee resettlement.
* Diversity includes gay and lesbian Canadians, who enjoy full legal protection, equal treatment, and access to civil
  marriage.
* Unity in diversity: Immigrant groups retain individuality while contributing to national character; all share common
  identity and values (e.g., rule of law, parliamentary government).
